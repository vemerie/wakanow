# WakanowTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

## Issues encountered

- No admin profile created yet

## What I was able to do so far

- Setup Tailwind for the project
- I was able to complete the UI for both registration and login as wess as the admin or logged in session
- I was able to integrate the endpoints for login, registrations and user listing using regres.in, how ever the endpoint is throwing errros.
- I was ablet to properly setup all the entire older structure and route structures base on the features requested
- I am a big fan of strongly typed code base and so i tried as much as possible to strongly type my data.

## Issues encountered

- I couldn't create create a user using the regres.io and so, no default admin also because there wasn't enough time for me to switch to other rest api provider like firebase or supabase.

## Any additional info

- Other than time and issues with Rest API provider,
